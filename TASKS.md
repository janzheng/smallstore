# Smallstore

Active work. See `TASKS.done.md` for shipped work; `TASKS-MAP.md`, `TASKS-DESIGN.md`, `TASKS-AUDIT.md`, `TASKS-TESTS.md` for area backlogs.

## Current

_All clear. See archive for shipped work._

## Later

- [ ] Publish to npm (`deno task build:npm && cd dist && npm publish`) #npm-publish
- [ ] Test and validate npm build works in Node.js projects #npm-validate
- [ ] Migrate coverflow-workers into smallstore-owned worker `-> foxfire .brief/smallstore-workers-takeover.md` #infra
- [*] LLM/agent features → see [TASKS-MAP.md Phase 8](./TASKS-MAP.md) (rerank, context window, RAG pipeline, semantic recall, working memory, etc.)

## Validation Holes

Pre-existing gaps from the 0.1.0 publish validation — none blocking, just need credentials to flip:

- [ ] `deno task interview:serve` — needs `GROQ_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- [ ] `deno task auth:airtable` — needs Airtable env vars
- [*] `deno task paste` — `.env` loading bug (pre-existing, not a publish blocker)
- [*] Cloudflare DO live test — DO binding not active on deployed worker (12/13 live adapter tests green)

## Dependency Notes

- [*] **Zod 4 migration shipped in coverflow on 2026-04-20** (`coverflow-v3` commits `2b9f8c04` + `c37d9722` + `36546951`). Smallstore is unaffected — grep confirms zero zod imports in `src/`. The "smallstore Zod schemas need updating too" note from the original v3-vs-v4 standoff turned out to be moot.
- [*] **Notion v5 cleanup learnings from coverflow** (cross-reference `/Users/janzheng/Desktop/Projects/_deno/coverflow/coverflow-v3` Archive section in TASKS.md):
  - The SDK v5 `after` param on `blocks.children.append` is `@deprecated` in types but still accepts at runtime. Coverflow added `position` support alongside `after` — same change applied here on 2026-04-21
  - Coverflow had a dead `shared/notion/api/` wrapper directory (13 files, zero imports) that hard-coded a v4-only `databases.query` call. Worth a periodic grep here for similar abandoned wrappers — they'd silently break a future bump
  - Coverflow's `notionModern.queryDatabase()` uses dataSources.query exclusively. Smallstore's version is more sophisticated — has SDK v4 fallback + raw HTTP fallback for older API versions. Keep the smallstore approach
- [*] @notionhq/client v5 and @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.29 both accept zod ^3.25 || ^4.0 — no forced upgrade if smallstore ever does add zod schemas
